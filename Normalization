Why Do We Need To Normalize Data in Python?
Machine learning algorithms tend to perform better or converge faster when the different features (variables) are on a smaller scale. Therefore it is common practice to normalize the data before training machine learning models on it.


Normalization also makes the training process less sensitive to the scale of the features. This results in getting better coefficients after training.

This process of making features more suitable for training by rescaling is called feature scaling.

The formula for Normalization is given below :

We subtract the minimum value from each entry and then divide the result by the range. Where range is the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value.


Steps to Normalize Data in Python
We are going to discuss two different ways to normalize data in python.

The first one is by using the method ‘normalize()‘ under sklearn.

Using normalize() from sklearn
Let’s start by importing processing from sklearn.

from sklearn import preprocessing
Now, let’s create an array using Numpy.

import numpy as np
x_array = np.array([2,3,5,6,7,4,8,7,6])
Now we can use the normalize() method on the array. This method normalizes data along a row. Let’s see the method in action.

normalized_arr = preprocessing.normalize([x_array])
print(normalized_arr)
Complete code
Here’s the complete code from this section :

from sklearn import preprocessing
import numpy as np
x_array = np.array([2,3,5,6,7,4,8,7,6])
normalized_arr = preprocessing.normalize([x_array])
print(normalized_arr)
Output :

[0.11785113, 0.1767767 , 0.29462783, 0.35355339, 0.41247896,
        0.23570226, 0.47140452, 0.41247896, 0.35355339]
We can see that all the values are now between the range 0 to 1. This is how the normalize() method under sklearn works.

You can also normalize columns in a dataset using this method. Let’s see how to do that next.
